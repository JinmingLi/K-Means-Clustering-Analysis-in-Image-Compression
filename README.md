# K-Means-Clustering-Analysis-in-Image-Compression

This project includes the codes I wrote to compress an image using K-means clustering by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.

I first programmed the K-means clustering analysis to sort out data through two functions (findClosestCentroids and computeCentroids). By that, I can see how K-means clustering algorithms sort different data into different groups. Then I tried to employ K-means on pixels to compress image. The results were satisfying which turned a 393,216 bits image into 65,920 bits image.
